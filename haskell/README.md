# Seven-languages

Homework for "Seven languages in seven weeks" book. So this is the haskell week ...

## Usage

If you use homebrew, you know what to do:

    brew install haskell-platform

Otherwise, check somewhere [here](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/).

Very short cheat sheet with `ghci`:

  * load a source: `:l source` (completion with `tab` key works)
  * launch tests: `runTestTT` but I wrapped it in the `main` function. More [here](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/HUnit/1.2.2.1/doc/html/Test-HUnit.html)
  * exit: `:q`

More [here](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.2.1/html/users_guide/using-ghc.html)

You can run tests with the little shell script `run_tests.sh`
