# Seven-languages in seven weeks

Homework for "Seven languages in seven weeks" book. Grab your own copy [here](http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks)

This is my own material, may not be the best code but enough to learn those new paradigms (func is fun !).
Sometimes I wrote tests, since I try also to learn through some TDD. So you may use them and try several implementation (refactoring FTW)

Enjoy!
