# Seven-languages

Homework for "Seven languages in seven weeks" book. So this is the ruby week ...

## Usage

Ruby is already installed on Mac OS X, but I prefer using `rvm`. Find more [here](http://rvm.io/). You can run script this way:

    ruby day1.rb
or
    day1.rb

I'm using script files and try to avoid classes to be well ... more interactive

TODO:
 [] testify and rakify all that scripts !!!! (just because I worth it ;)
