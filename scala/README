# Seven-languages

Homework for "Seven languages in seven weeks" book. So this is the scala week ...

## Usage

Project is built with `sbt`. If you use homebrew, you know what to do:

    brew install sbt

Otherwise, check the [project](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/)

And then,

    cd seven-languages;sbt cucumber

The *.sh files are just an example of how to run scala scripts but there is no test for now.

TODO:
 [] refactoring .sh files
