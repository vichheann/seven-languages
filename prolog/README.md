# Seven-languages

Homework for "Seven languages in seven weeks" book. So this is the prolog week ...

## Usage

Instead of using GNU Prolog, I use SWI Prolog because it reminds me my student years :)

If you use homebrew, you know what to do:

    brew install swi-prolog

Otherwise, check somewhere [here](http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable).

Very short cheat sheet with `swipl`:

  * load a source: `[source].` (completion with `tab` key works)
  * launch tests: `run_tests`. More [here](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/package/plunit.html)
  * exit: `halt.`

More [here](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/refman/)

You can run tests with the little shell script `run_tests.sh`
